            <li><b>1955</b> - Steve was born in San Francisco, the son of Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble. He
                was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs</li>

            <li><b>1972</b> - After graduating from high school, Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon,
                for two years. Steve and Woz build and illegally sell 'blue boxes' that allow to make phone calls for
                free. He dropped out after one semester to visit India.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b>1975</b> - In 1975 Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a technical
                whiz named Steve Wozniak, was trying to build a computer. Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the
                Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which
                was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b>1976</b> -
                Woz and Steve show the early Apple I board at the Homebrew Computer Club. In 1976 he and Wozniak formed
                their own company. They called it Apple Computer Company, in
                memory of a happy summer Jobs had spent picking apples. They raised $1,300 in startup money by selling
                Jobs's calculator.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b>1984</b> - Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh. The on-screen display
                had small pictures called icons. To use the computer, the user pointed at an icon and clicked a button
                using a new device called a mouse. The Apple II becomes the first mass-market personal computer, with
                impressive sales around the US. Apple becomes a symbol of the personal computing revolution
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b>1985</b> - The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple.Steve Jobs
                resigns from Apple and starts NeXT with five other refugees from Apple. </li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b>1986</b> - NeXT was not, however, the end of Steve Jobs. Jobs purchased a small company
                called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas. Pixar specialized in computer animation. Nine years
                later Pixar released Toy Story, a huge
                box office hit. Created animated movies and making it more joyful and interesting.</li>

            <li><b>1988</b> - Jobs soon hired some of his former employees to begin a new computer company called NeXT.
                The product was very user-friendly, and had a fast processing speed, excellent
                graphics displays, and an outstanding sound system. Despite the warm reception, however, the NeXT
                machine never caught on as it was too costly and
                had a black-and-white screen. </li> <br><br>

            <li><b>1992</b> - NeXT licenses its operating system, NeXTSTEP, to run on x86 machines</li> <br><br>

            <li><b>1996</b> -
                Apple, which was desperately looking for a modern operating system to buy, eventually buys NeXT for $400
                million. Steve Jobs is named "informal adviser" to Apple CEO Gil Amelio.<br>
                <br>The following year, in a surprising event, Apple entered into a partnership with its
                competitor Microsoft. The two companies, according to the New York Times, "agreed to cooperate on
                several sales and technology fronts".
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b>1997</b> - In November 1997 Jobs announced Apple would sell computers directly to users over the
                Internet and by telephone. The Apple Store became a runaway success. Within a week it was the
                third-largest e-commerce site on the Internet.

                was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of
                ten Americans were aware of its
                release.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b>2011</b> - Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to
                complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,which
                resulted in respiratory arrest.
                He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side. His
                sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables,
                repeated three times. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh
                wow.'" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later.</li>

            <p class="font"><i>I was lucky to get into computers when it was a very young and idealistic industry. There
                    weren't many degrees offered in computer science, so people in computers were brilliant people from
                    mathematics, physics, music, zoology, whatever. They loved it, and no one was really in it for the
                    money... There are people around here who start companies just to make money, but the great
                    companies, well, that's not what they're about."</i> <br><br>
